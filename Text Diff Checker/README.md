# Text Diff Checker

Text Diff Checker is a Python script that compares the differences between two text files and displays the added and removed lines. It can be useful for tracking changes in files or identifying modifications between versions.

## Features

- Compares two text files and shows added and removed lines.
- Provides a timestamp for each change.
- Simple and easy-to-use script.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `text_diff_checker.py` script.

2. Open a command-line interface (CLI) or terminal.

3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

4. Run the script using the following command:

`python text_diff_checker.py file1.txt file2.txt`


Replace `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` with the paths to the text files you want to compare.

5. The script will display the differences between the files, showing the added and removed lines along with the timestamp of the comparison.

## Example

Let's say you have two text files named `original.txt` and `modified.txt` in the same directory. To compare them, run the following command:

`python text_diff_checker.py original.txt modified.txt`


The script will analyze the differences between the two files and display the added and removed lines with timestamps.
