# Index Tuning Pre-steps

This repository contains a Python script that performs pre-steps for index tuning in a software system or application. The script analyzes and processes indexes to optimize their performance and resource usage.

## Description

The `index_tuning_presteps` script is designed to automate the pre-steps required for index tuning. It performs the following tasks:

1. Identifies relevant configuration files associated with the indexes.
2. Parses the configuration files to extract sizing comments.
3. Processes each index:
   - Determines the license usage per day.
   - Calculates the compression ratio and related metrics.
   - Identifies summary indexes and their usage patterns.
4. Removes specified indexes from the tuning process based on the ignore list.
5. (Optional) Excludes metric indexes from tuning based on their data type.

## Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed (version X.X.X or higher).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the script file.
3. Install any necessary dependencies, such as the `logging` module.
4. Open the script file in a text editor.
5. Customize the parameters and configuration options as needed.
6. Execute the script using the Python interpreter: `python index_tuning_presteps.py`.
7. View the logs generated by the script to monitor the execution and results.

Please note that this script is intended for use in a specific context and may require modifications or adaptations to suit your specific environment and requirements.
